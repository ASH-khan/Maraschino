###Getting Started
If you're working with a framework such as Twitter Bootstrap or Ionic, you may already have the fonts and css installed. If so, skip to **step 6: selecting icons**. To install icon font(s), do the following:

**1. Download 1 or more icon fonts**. We've got links to them here: http://maraschino.lizmyers.webfactional.com/#downloads

**2. Unzip the files to your desktop**

**3. Move the fonts into your project like this:**

<img src = "https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1979777/8267087/c3b0afa2-174a-11e5-92b5-82566b937618.jpg" />
  
  
**4. Move the CSS file(s) into your project like this**

**5. In index.html, link your icons to your project like this:**

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1979777/8267619/59e39bae-1761-11e5-8ce1-21087d9e32de.jpg" />

```
  <head>
    <!--Example: connecting Ionicons to project -->
    <link href="/resources/css/ionic.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
```

**6. Use <a href="http://maraschino.lizmyers.webfactional.com/index2.html" target="_blank">Maraschino</a> to "Cherry Pick" Icons for your project**

**From within you HTML, call your icons using the css code like this:**

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1979777/8267558/f45b8834-175e-11e5-96e9-4e993a817ff5.jpg" />
```

```

###Help Wanted

Being able to cherry pick icons for your project and see them all in a "virtual basket" is great - but - it would be so much better if we could download the basket as a skinny icon font. This would boost performance and make our customers very happy.

Unfortunately, the technologies involved are a bit beyond my skill set. The creators of <a href="http://font-custom.com">font-custom</a> were kind enough to point us in the right direction and offer tips from time to time. But what's really needed here is a volunteer. Are you the one who can help make this open source project more useful for everyone? If so, please get in touch and let's make it happen!
